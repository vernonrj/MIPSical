# MIPSical - a MIPS emulator written in rust

Like all my favorite projects, this one started out of boredom. I originally learned
about the MIPS 5-stage pipeline at university. For the past few months I've really
been enjoying rust, and I wanted another project to toy with.

So here it is.

The ISA implementation comes from this wonderful pdf I found on The Google:

    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15740-f97/public/doc/mips-isa.pdf

Generally, I plan to get the ISA up and running, then start working on a basic
five-stage pipeline, then get actual emulation working by reading binaries.
